# Router-Simulation-Program

Router simulation program that uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient shortest path computation.

Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu to perform various actions:

1. Create Router and Add Neighbors: Create routers and specify incoming and outgoing neighbors.
2. Find Path: Find the shortest path between two routers.
3. Print Routing Tables: Display routing tables of all routers in the network.
4. Delete Router: Delete a router from the network.
5. Exit: Exit the program.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired actions.
